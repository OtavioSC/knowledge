# Turing Machine

Abstract mathematical structures help us to precisely describe what computation means.

The Turing machine was created by Alan Turing in 1936 at Princeton.

This machine is capable of doing everything that a computer can.

How is it possible to solve problems not only by following intuition or inspiration, but also by following rules very accurately and carefully, in other words, by following an algorithm?

Turing answered this question with his machine called the Turing machine.

The machine had an infinite tape and a "reader" that passed over the tape and read a symbol on it (0, 1, or blank). After reading the symbol, the captured information was transformed into a set of rules to solve a problem, similar to a CPU.
