## Big-O is a notation that uses algebra to determine the complexity of an algorithm.

### Big-O is always interested in the worst case.

### O(log n) -> Log Time (eg binary search)

### O(n) -> Linear Time (eg simple search)

### O(n log n) -> Fast Sorting (eg quicksort)

### O(nÂ²) -> Slow Sorting (eg selection sort)

### O(n!) -> Really Slow (eg traveling salesperson)
